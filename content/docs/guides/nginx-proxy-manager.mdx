title: Nginx Proxy Manager
description: Use Tinyauth with the Nginx Proxy Manager reverse proxy.
---

Nginx Proxy Manager is definitely a piece of software that everybody loves in the homelab community. This is why it is mandatory that Tinyauth supports it. It's a bit different compared to traefik/caddy due to nginx itself not supporting 302 redirects for the `auth_request` module but Tinyauth accounts for it and has API paths made just for it!

  This tutorial assumes you have some experience with Nginx Proxy Manager.

## Example docker compose file

Throughout this tutorial we will use the following docker compose file:

```yaml
services:
  npm:
    container_name: npm
    image: jc21/nginx-proxy-manager:2
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - 80:80
      - 443:443
      - 81:81
    volumes:
      - npm-data:/data
      - npm-letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt

  nginx:
    container_name: nginx
    image: nginx:latest
    restart: unless-stopped

  tinyauth:
    container_name: tinyauth
    image: ghcr.io/steveiliop56/tinyauth:v4
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - APP_URL=http://tinyauth.example.com
      - USERS=user:$$2a$$10$$UdLYoJ5lgPsC0RKqYH/jMua7zIn0g9kPqWmhYayJYLaZQ/FTmH2/u # user:password

volumes:
  npm-data:
  npm-letsencrypt:
```

You can configure OAuth and access controls as you normally would with docker labels and environment variables, all the configuration will happen through the UI.

## Configuring Nginx Proxy Manager

Firstly you need to create the Tinyauth host, it is really simple as you have to configure it as every other host:

<img
  src="/screenshots/npm-tinyauth.png"
  alt="Nginx Proxy Manager Tinyauth host"
  width="512"
/>

You can also setup your SSL if you are using certificates.

<Callout type="warning">
  Make sure that block common exploits is disabled. If it is enabled Nginx will
  not allow URLs in the query parameters which is required for Tinyauth to
  function.
</Callout>

Now you need to configure the protected hosts, in this case it is Nginx. For the Details tab you need to fill it the same way you did with Tinyauth which looks like this:

<img
  src="/screenshots/npm-nginx.png"
  alt="Nginx Proxy Manager Nginx host"
  width="512"
/>

Again, you can configure your SSL as you like.

<Callout type="info">
  Here you can keep the block common exploits enabled.
</Callout>

Now for the important part. You need the following config in the Advanced tab in order for Nginx to use Tinyauth to authenticate:

```shell
# Root location
location / {
  # Pass the request to the app
  proxy_pass          $forward_scheme://$server:$port;

  # Add other app specific config here

  # Tinyauth auth request
  auth_request /tinyauth;
  error_page 401 = @tinyauth_login;
}

# Tinyauth auth request
location /tinyauth {
  # Pass request to Tinyauth
  proxy_pass http://tinyauth:3000/api/auth/nginx;

  # Pass the request headers
  proxy_set_header x-forwarded-proto $scheme;
  proxy_set_header x-forwarded-host $http_host;
  proxy_set_header x-forwarded-uri $request_uri;
}

# Tinyauth login redirect
location @tinyauth_login {
  return 302 http://tinyauth.example.com/login?redirect_uri=$scheme://$http_host$request_uri; # Make sure to replace the http://tinyauth.example.com with your own app URL
}
```

<Callout type="info">
  The `/tinyauth` path can be anything, the guide uses this name for
  convenience.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  You may need to add additional configuration under the `/` location for
  technologies like websockets to work.
</Callout>

Now we can save the host and when you try to access it you should be redirected to the Tinyauth login page if you are not already logged in. Keep in mind you will need to do this for every host you want Tinyauth to protect.
