description: Use GitHub OAuth for authenticating to Tinyauth.

Tinyauth has built-in support for GitHub OAuth with just two environment variables. Most of the configuration happens on the GitHub side rather than Tinyauth.

## Requirements

- A domain name (non-gTLDs are supported)
- A GitHub account

## Creating the GitHub OAuth App

Begin by creating a GitHub OAuth app. Navigate to the [GitHub developer settings](https://github.com/settings/developers) and click **New OAuth App**. Fill in the following details:

| Name                       | Value                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Application name           | Can be anything, e.g., `Tinyauth`.                                                                                         |
| Homepage URL               | Can be any URL, e.g., `https://tinyauth.app`.                                                                              |
| Authorization Callback URL | Enter the domain followed by `/api/oauth/callback/github`, e.g., `https://tinyauth.example.com/api/oauth/callback/github`. |

After entering the details, click **Register Application**.

## Retrieving Credentials

Once the application is created, the following screen will appear:

Note down the client ID. To generate the client secret, click **Generate a new client secret**. GitHub will prompt for login confirmation and then display the secret:

Note down the client ID and secret for later use.

## Configuring Tinyauth

Add the following environment variables to the Tinyauth Docker container:

```yaml
services:
  tinyauth:
    environment:
      - PROVIDERS_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your-github-client-id
      - PROVIDERS_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your-github-secret
```

<Callout type="warning">
  OAuth alone does not guarantee security. By default, any GitHub account can
  log in as a normal user. To restrict access, use the `OAUTH_WHITELIST`
  environment variable to allow specific email addresses. Refer to the
  [configuration](/docs/reference/configuration) page for details.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  With OAuth enabled, the `USERS` or `USERS_FILE` environment variables can be
  removed to allow login exclusively through the OAuth provider.
</Callout>

Restart Tinyauth. Upon visiting the login screen, an additional option to log in with GitHub will appear.
