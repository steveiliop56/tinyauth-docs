description: Use a centralized LDAP server for user management in Tinyauth.
---

LDAP, while often associated with businesses, can be highly effective for centralizing user management in a homelab environment. Tinyauth supports LDAP as a user source, making it easier to manage users across applications.

## Requirements

An LDAP server is required to proceed. [LLDAP](https://github.com/lldap/lldap) is recommended for its lightweight design and ease of configuration. This guide uses LLDAP, but any LDAP server is compatible.

## Creating Users

Tinyauth requires at least two users: an observer user with read-only access to the database (used by Tinyauth to search for user DNs) and a normal user for logging in to Tinyauth and applications.

### Creating the Observer User

1. Navigate to the **Users** tab in LLDAP and click **Create a user**.
2. Provide a username, password, and email address, then click **Submit**.

3. After creating the user, select it from the list and scroll to the group memberships section. Add the user to the `lldap_strict_readonly` group by clicking **Add to Group**.

### Creating Additional Users

Repeat the process to create additional users. Normal users do not need to belong to any groups.

## Configuring Tinyauth

To connect Tinyauth to the LDAP server, add the following environment variables to the Tinyauth Docker container:

```yaml
services:
  tinyauth:
    environment:
      - LDAP_ADDRESS=ldap://my-lldap-server:3890
      - LDAP_BIND_DN=uid=your-observer-user,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com
      - LDAP_BIND_PASSWORD=your-observer-user-password
      - LDAP_BASE_DN=dc=example,dc=com
      - LDAP_SEARCH_FILTER=(uid=%s)
      - LDAP_INSECURE=true
```

<Callout type="info">
  The search filter can be customized as needed. The base filter `(uid=%s)`
  searches for users based on their UID, with `%s` replaced by the username of
  the user attempting to log in.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  Replace the bind DN and base DN with values specific to the LDAP server
  configuration.
</Callout>

After restarting, logging in to Tinyauth with the second user created in LLDAP should be possible. Additional users can be created and used for login as needed.

<Callout type="info">
  LDAP users are treated the same as users from files or environment variables.
  There is no indication in the UI that a user is logged in via LDAP. All access
  controls apply equally to LDAP users and standard users.
</Callout>
