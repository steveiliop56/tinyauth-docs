description: Use Tinyauth with the Runtipi homeserver management platform.
---

Runtipi is a very popular open source personal homeserver helper that enables you to manage and run multiple services on a single server. For more information check the [website](https://runtipi.io). Due to the very powerful proxy features it offers, it can be easily integrated with Tinyauth to offer a seamless authentication experience. Let's see how you can set it up in under five minutes.

## Create your users and OAuth clients

You firstly need to create your users, this can be done with the Tinyauth [CLI](/docs/reference/cli#create-user-command). Make sure to select yes in the format for docker option else Tinyauth won't be able to parse the user.

The Runtipi app also includes inputs for Github and Google, so if you would like to use OAuth you can follow the OAuth guides and note down your client IDs and secrets.

## Change the forward auth middleware

Runtipi by default uses its own login screen for authentication, we want to replace that with Tinyauth. This can be done by enabling advanced settings:

  alt="Enable advanced settings"

/>

And setting the forward auth URL to `http://tinyauth:3000/api/auth/traefik`:

Finally make sure to save your settings and restart Runtipi.

  From Runtipi version v4, multiple appstore support was added. This means that
  the container name may change. If you are unable to get redirected to the
  Tinyauth login screen, try using
  `http://tinyauth_migrated-tinyauth-1:3000/api/auth/traefik` as the forward
  auth URL instead.

## Install Tinyauth

Now we can go to the appstore tab, click the Tinyauth app, fill in our users, OAuth credentials and any other information you like. But before clicking install, you need to either flip the local domain switch or the expose switch to expose Tinyauth to a domain. This is required for Tinyauth to function as it will not be able to set the cookies correctly through the port. So, depending on your setup either use your local domain as an app URL or the expose domain as app URL (in either case you should use https). Finally click install and everything should be good to go.

  You can customize more aspects of Tinyauth, like adding more OAuth providers
  by using Runtipi's
  [user-config](https://runtipi.io/docs/guides/customize-app-config).

## Enabling authentication for apps

From now on, you can enable authentication for every app you like by opening its settings and flipping the enable authentication switch:

  src="/screenshots/runtipi-install-app-example.png"
  alt="Install app example"
  width="512"
/>

<Callout type="warning">
  For authentication to work correctly you either need to use the local domain
  or make sure that the expose domain is under the same root level domain as
  tinyauth. For example `tinyauth.example.com` and `nginx.example.com` will work
  but `tinyauth.domain1.com` and `nginx.domain2.com` will **not** work.
