description: Use Google's OAuth screen to authenticate to Tinyauth.

Tinyauth has built-in support for Google OAuth, making it straightforward to set up.

## Requirements

- A domain name (gTLDs required)
- A Google account

## Creating the Google OAuth App

To begin, create an app in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/). Create a new project (a default project may already exist). After creating the project, the following screen should appear:

![Google Cloud Console Home](/screenshots/google-cloud-home.png)

From the quick access menu, click **APIs & Services**, then select **OAuth consent screen** from the sidebar. Click the **Get Started** button in the middle of the screen.

<Callout type="info">
  Google has updated the OAuth section. This guide uses the new OAuth
  experience. If a button appears saying "Try the new OAuth experience," click
  it to match the steps in this guide.
</Callout>

After clicking the button, the following screen should appear:

![Configure OAuth Consent Screen](/screenshots/google-cloud-oauth-configure.png)

- **App Name**: Use `Tinyauth`.
- **Support Email**: Select the available email address.
- **Audience**: Choose **External**.
- **Contact Information**: Enter an email address.
- Agree to the data use policy and click **Create**.

After some time, the OAuth homepage will appear:

![Google Cloud OAuth Home](/screenshots/google-cloud-oauth-home.png)

Click **Create OAuth Client**.

<Callout type="info">
  If a warning appears about the OAuth Consent Screen not being configured,
  refresh the page a few times to proceed.
</Callout>

- **Application Type**: Select **Web Application**.
- **Name**: Optionally rename the client (default is `Web Client 1`).
- **Authorized Redirect URIs**: Add the domain with the `/api/oauth/callback/google` suffix, e.g., `https://tinyauth.example.com/api/oauth/callback/google`.

Click **Create**. Once the application is created, the following screen will appear:

![Google Cloud OAuth Clients](/screenshots/google-cloud-oauth-created.png)

Click the client (e.g., `Web Client 1`) and copy the Client ID and Client Secret from the Additional Information section.

## Configuring Tinyauth

Add the following environment variables to the Tinyauth Docker container:

```yaml
services:
  tinyauth:
    environment:
      - PROVIDERS_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
      - PROVIDERS_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-secret
```

<Callout type="warning">
  OAuth alone does not guarantee security. By default, any GitHub account can
  log in as a normal user. To restrict access, use the `OAUTH_WHITELIST`
  environment variable to allow specific email addresses. Refer to the
  [configuration](/docs/reference/configuration) page for details.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  With OAuth enabled, the `USERS` or `USERS_FILE` environment variables can be
  removed to allow login exclusively through the OAuth provider.
</Callout>

Restart Tinyauth. Upon visiting the login screen, an additional option to log in with Google will appear.
