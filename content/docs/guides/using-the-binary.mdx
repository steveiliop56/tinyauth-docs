title: Using the binary
description: Use the Tinyauth binary instead of the docker image for more advanced setups.

If you prefer bare-metal over docker, you can use the Tinyauth binary. This setup is ideal for LXC containers or machines that don't need to run docker but you would still like to use Tinyauth to protect your services.

## Downloading the binary

To begin with, simply download the binary from the [latest](https://github.com/steveiliop56/tinyauth/releases/latest) GitHub release. There are builds available for both `arm64` and `amd64` linux machines. I suggest renaming the binary to `tinyauth` as that's what we will use for the rest of this guide. I also suggest ensuring that the binary is executable:

```sh
chmod +x tinyauth
```

## Configuration

To configure Tinyauth, you can use either CLI flags or environment variables (recommended). To use environment variables, you will need to download the example environment file from Github:

```sh
curl -o .env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/steveiliop56/tinyauth/refs/heads/main/.env.example
```

Then, you can simply edit the `.env` file and either replace the template values with actual values or simply remove the environment variables you do not need.

Alternatively, you can use CLI flags to configure Tinyauth. This is not recommended as it can get quite complex and your shell may parse the values incorrectly. Make sure to always use quotes (`'`) to ensure that the values are given to Tinyauth correctly.

A full list of environment variables and CLI flags is available in the [configuration](/docs/reference/configuration) page.

## Running

After you are done with the configuration, you can start Tinyauth. If you are using environment variables, you need to set them in your shell, this can be done by running:

```sh
export $(grep -v '^#' .env | xargs -d '\n')
```

<Callout type="tip">
  If you like, you can unset the environment variables (perhaps for security
  reasons) with `unset $(grep -v '^#' .env | sed -E 's/(.*)=.*/\1/' | xargs)`.
</Callout>

Finally you can start the Tinyauth server with:

```sh
./tinyauth
```

If you chose to use CLI flags you need to pass them to Tinyauth:

```sh
./tinyauth --app-url=https://tinyauth.example.com
```

## Running as a systemd service

If you need Tinyauth to autostart on boot, you can use a systemd service (assuming you are using systemd as your init system). Firstly you will need to create the service:

```ini title='/etc/systemd/system/tinyauth.service'
[Unit]
Description=Tinyauth service
After=network.target

[Service]
EnvironmentFile=/some/path/.env
ExecStart=/some/path/tinyauth
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

<Callout type="info">
  Make sure to replace the paths in the service with the actual locations of
  your environment and binary files.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip">
  If you are using CLI flags, you can remove the `EnvironmentFile` line and add
  your flags to to the `ExecStart` line, e.g. `ExecStart=/some/path/tinyauth
  --app-url=https://tinyauth.example.com`.
</Callout>

Finally you need to reload the systemd daemon:

```sh
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

And start the new service:

```sh
sudo systemctl enable --now tinyauth
```

You can view the logs of Tinyauth by running:

```sh
sudo journalctl -efu tinyauth
```

That's it! Tinyauth should automatically start on boot.
