title: Using the binary
description: Use the Tinyauth binary instead of the docker image for more advanced setups.
---

For setups that do not require Docker, the Tinyauth binary provides a lightweight alternative. This approach is ideal for LXC containers or machines where Docker is unnecessary but Tinyauth is still required to protect services.

## Downloading the Binary

The binary can be downloaded from the [latest GitHub release](https://github.com/steveiliop56/tinyauth/releases/latest). Builds are available for both `arm64` and `amd64` Linux machines. Renaming the binary to `tinyauth` is recommended for consistency throughout this guide. Ensure the binary is executable:

```sh
chmod +x tinyauth
```

## Configuration

Configuration can be achieved using either CLI flags or environment variables (recommended). To use environment variables, download the example `.env` file from GitHub:

```sh
curl -o .env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/steveiliop56/tinyauth/refs/heads/main/.env.example
```

Edit the `.env` file to replace template values with actual values or remove unnecessary variables. Alternatively, CLI flags can be used for configuration, though this method is less recommended due to potential complexity and shell parsing issues. Always use quotes (`'`) to ensure values are passed correctly.

A complete list of environment variables and CLI flags is available on the [configuration](/docs/reference/configuration) page.

## Running

Once configured, start Tinyauth. For environment variable-based setups, export the variables in the shell:

```sh
export $(grep -v '^#' .env | xargs -d '\n')
```

<Callout type="tip">
  To unset the environment variables for security purposes, use: `unset $(grep
  -v '^#' .env | sed -E 's/(.*)=.*/\1/' | xargs)`.
</Callout>

Start the Tinyauth server:

```sh
./tinyauth
```

For CLI flag-based setups, pass the flags directly:

```sh
./tinyauth --app-url=https://tinyauth.example.com
```

## Running as a systemd Service

To enable Tinyauth to start automatically on boot, create a systemd service. First, create the service file:

```ini title="/etc/systemd/system/tinyauth.service"
[Unit]
Description=Tinyauth service
After=network.target

[Service]
EnvironmentFile=/some/path/.env
ExecStart=/some/path/tinyauth
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

<Callout type="info">
  Replace the paths in the service file with the actual locations of the
  environment and binary files.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip">
  For CLI flag-based setups, remove the `EnvironmentFile` line and append the
  flags to the `ExecStart` line, e.g., `ExecStart=/some/path/tinyauth
  --app-url=https://tinyauth.example.com`.
</Callout>

Reload the systemd daemon:

```sh
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

Enable and start the service:

```sh
sudo systemctl enable --now tinyauth
```

Logs can be viewed with:

```sh
sudo journalctl -efu tinyauth
```

Tinyauth will now start automatically on boot.
