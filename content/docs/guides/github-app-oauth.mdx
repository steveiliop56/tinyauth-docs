title: GitHub Apps OAuth
description: Use the GitHub Apps OAuth screen for authenticating to Tinyauth.
---

Tinyauth also supports GitHub Apps for authentication instead of OAuth Apps. GitHub Apps allow more control over permissions and are slightly more complex to set up. For simpler setups, the [OAuth Apps](/docs/guides/github-oauth.md) guide is recommended.

## Requirements

GitHub requires the following to set up an app:

- A domain name (non-gTLDs are supported)
- A GitHub account

## Creating the GitHub App

Open the [GitHub Apps](https://github.com/settings/apps) site and click **New GitHub App**. The following screen will appear:

Fill in the following information:

| Name            | Value                                                                                                                          |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| GitHub App Name | The name for the app, e.g., `Tinyauth`.                                                                                        |
| Homepage URL    | Any URL, e.g., `https://tinyauth.app`.                                                                                         |
| Callback URL    | The Tinyauth app URL followed by `/api/oauth/callback/github`, e.g., `https://tinyauth.example.com/api/oauth/callback/github`. |

Under webhook, ensure the **Active** checkbox is unchecked as webhooks are not required.

In the **Permissions** section, click **Account permissions** and set the **Email Addresses** option to **Read-only**:

Create the app. The following screen will appear:

Note the client ID. To generate the client secret, click **Generate new client secret**. After authentication, the secret will appear:

Note down the client ID and secret as they will be required for Tinyauth.

## Configuring Tinyauth

Add the following environment variables to the Tinyauth Docker container:

```yaml
services:
  tinyauth:
    environment:
      - PROVIDERS_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your-github-client-id
      - PROVIDERS_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your-github-secret
```

<Callout type="warning">
  OAuth alone does not guarantee security. By default, any GitHub account can
  log in as a normal user. To restrict access, use the `OAUTH_WHITELIST`
  environment variable to allow specific email addresses. Refer to the
  [configuration](/docs/reference/configuration) page for details.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip">
  With OAuth enabled, the `USERS` or `USERS_FILE` environment variables can be
  removed to allow login exclusively through the OAuth provider.
</Callout>

Restart Tinyauth. Upon visiting the login screen, an additional option to log in with GitHub will appear.
