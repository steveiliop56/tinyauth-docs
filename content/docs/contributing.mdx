Contributing to Tinyauth is straightforward. Follow the steps below to set up a development server in under five minutes.

## Requirements

- Bun
- Golang v1.23.2 or later
- Git
- Docker

## Cloning the Repository

Start by cloning the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/steveiliop56/tinyauth
cd tinyauth
```

## Installing Requirements

While development occurs within Docker, installing the requirements locally is recommended to avoid import errors. Install the Go dependencies:

```sh
go mod tidy
```

Frontend dependencies can be installed as follows:

```sh
cd frontend/
bun install
```

## Creating the `.env` File

Configuration requires an environment file. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and adjust the environment variables as needed.

## Development Workflow

The development workflow is designed to run entirely within Docker, ensuring compatibility with Traefik and eliminating the need for local builds. A recommended setup involves pointing a subdomain to the local machine:

```
*.dev.example.com -> 127.0.0.1
dev.example.com -> 127.0.0.1
```

<Callout type="tip">
  A domain from [sslip.io](https://sslip.io) can be used if a custom domain is
  unavailable.
</Callout>

Ensure the domains are correctly configured in the development Docker Compose file, then start the development environment:

```sh
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```

<Callout type="tip">
  Copying the example `docker-compose.dev.yml` file to `docker-compose.test.yml`
  is recommended to prevent accidental commits of sensitive information.
</Callout>
