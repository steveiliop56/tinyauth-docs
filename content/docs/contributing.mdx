Contributing is relatively easy, you just need to follow the steps below and you will be up and running with a development server in less than five minutes.

## Requirements

- Bun
- Golang v1.23.2 and above
- Git
- Docker

## Cloning the repository

You firstly need to clone the repository with:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/steveiliop56/tinyauth
cd tinyauth
```

## Install requirements

Although you will not need the requirements in your machine since the development will happen in docker, I still recommend to install them because this way you will not have import errors. To install the go requirements run:

```sh
go mod tidy
```

You also need to download the frontend dependencies, this can be done like so:

```sh
cd frontend/
bun install
```

## Create your `.env` file

In order to configure the app you need to create an environment file, this can be done by copying the `.env.example` file to `.env` and modifying the environment variables to suit your needs.

## Developing

I have designed the development workflow to be entirely in docker, this is because it will directly work with Traefik and you will not need to do any building in your host machine. The recommended development setup is to have a subdomain pointing to your machine like this:

```
*.dev.example.com -> 127.0.0.1
dev.example.com -> 127.0.0.1
```

<Callout type="tip">
  You can use a domain from [sslip.io](https://sslip.io) if you don't have one
  to develop with.
</Callout>

Then you can just make sure the domains are correct in the development docker-compose file and run:

```sh
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```

<Callout type="tip">
  I recommend copying the example `docker-compose.dev.yml` into a
  `docker-compose.test.yml` file, so as you don't accidentally commit any
  sensitive information.
</Callout>
