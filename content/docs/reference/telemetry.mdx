description: Information about telemetry in Tinyauth.
---

Tinyauth includes a heartbeat feature that send anonymous version information to get some insights on the usage of Tinyauth. The collected information includes:

- Tinyauth version
- Instance UUID (generated with UUID v4 from the app URL)
- Time of the request

<Callout type="info">
  The UUID generated from the app URL is an irreversible hash and cannot be used
  to identify the instance.
</Callout>

The data is sent to `https://api.tinyauth.app/v1/instances/hearbeat` every 12 hours. No personal, sensitive or identifiable information is collected. The heartbeat can be disabled with:

| Environment         | CLI Flag              | Default |
| ------------------- | --------------------- | ------- |
| `DISABLE_ANALYTICS` | `--disable-analytics` | `false` |

<Callout type="info">
  Your IP address may be stored in an in-memory cache for a short period to
  prevent abuse of the API server.
</Callout>

The telemetry server source is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/steveiliop56/tinyauth-analytics) licensed under the MIT license.
