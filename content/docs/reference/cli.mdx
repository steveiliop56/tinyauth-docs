Tinyauth offers a very simple CLI that aims to help you configure the app and manage users.

## Commands

All commands can be run from the standalone Tinyauth binary:

```sh
./tinyauth [options]
```

As well as when the app is running through docker:

```sh
docker run -i -t --rm ghcr.io/steveiliop56/tinyauth:v4 [options]
```

<Callout type="tip">
  If you are using docker compose you can also use `docker compose run tinyauth
  [options]`.
</Callout>

### Main command

The main command is the one being used when you run the app without any flags/arguments. It starts the API and web UI and waits for incoming connections. All the options are configurable with both CLI flags and environment variables. A list of available configuration options is located in the [configuration](/docs/reference/configuration) page.

### Create user command

You can use the create command to easily create a user without needing any other tools. To create a user simply run:

```sh
./tinyauth user create --interactive
```

This command will launch an interactive TUI where you can provide a username, a password and it will generate the `username:hash` format required by tinyauth. It can also auto-format the user for docker if you would like to use it within a docker-compose file or in environment variables. Apart from the interactive mode you can also create a user with flags:

```sh
./tinyauth user create --username user@example.com --password password
```

The full list of available flags:

| Flag            | Description                                                                     | Default | Required |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | -------- |
| `--username`    | The username to use in order to create the user.                                | ``      | yes      |
| `--password`    | The password to use in order to create the user.                                | ``      | yes      |
| `--docker`      | Format the output for use within docker-compose files or environment variables. | `false` | no       |
| `--interactive` | Use an interactive TUI for creating the user.                                   | `false` | no       |

### Verify user command

In addition to the create command, Tinyauth offers a verify command to make sure your username and password match with the `username:hash`. To use it just run:

```sh
./tinyauth user verify --interactive
```

A TUI will be launched prompting you for your `username:hash` combination, your username and your password, then it will check if the credentials match. You can also use the non-interactive mode like so:

```sh
./tinyauth user verify --user 'user@example.com:$2a$10$UdLYoJ5lgPsC0RKqYH/jMua7zIn0g9kPqWmhYayJYLaZQ/FTmH2/u' --username user@example.com --password password
```

<Callout type="note">
  Make sure to use quotes (`'`) when typing this in a bash shell so your hash
  gets passed correctly to Tinyauth.
</Callout>

The full list of available options for the verify command are the following:

| Flag            | Description                                         | Default | Required |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------- | -------- |
| `--user`        | The `username:hash` combination to verify.          | ``      | yes      |
| `--username`    | The username to use in order to verify the user.    | ``      | yes      |
| `--password`    | The password to use in order to verify the user.    | ``      | yes      |
| `--interactive` | Use an interactive TUI in order to verify the user. | `false` | no       |
| `--totp`        | Optional TOTP code if you are using TOTP.           | ``      | no       |

### Generate TOTP command

Tinyauth can auto generate TOTP codes for you, the combination is `username:hash:secret`. You can generate a TOTP user with:

```sh
./tinyauth totp generate -i
```

It will prompt you for your current user (`username:hash`) and then give you your new user (`username:hash:secret`) alongside with a QR code so as you can add it to your authenticator app. You can also use the non-interactive mode like this:

```sh
./tinyauth totp generate --user 'user@example.com:$2a$10$UdLYoJ5lgPsC0RKqYH/jMua7zIn0g9kPqWmhYayJYLaZQ/FTmH2/u'
```

<Callout type="note">
  Make sure to use quotes (`'`) when typing this in a bash shell so your hash
  gets passed correctly to Tinyauth.
</Callout>

The full list of available options for the TOTP generate command are the following:

| Flag            | Description                                        | Default | Required |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------- | -------- |
| `--user`        | The `username:hash` combination to verify.         | ``      | yes      |
| `--interactive` | Use an interactive TUI for creating the TOTP user. | `false` | no       |
