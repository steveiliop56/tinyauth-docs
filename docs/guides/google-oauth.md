# OAuth with Google

Tinyauth has builtin support for Google OAuth and it is extremely easy to set up. It's a bit harder than Github but with this guide you should be up and running in less than ten minutes. Let's get started!

## Requirements

For this guide you will need the following:

- A domain name (gTLDs required)
- A Google account.

## Create the Google OAuth app

To begin with, you need to create an app in Google. This can be done by visiting the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/). There you need to create a new project (you should already have one by default) and after creating it, you should see a screen like this:

![Google Cloud Console Home](/screenshots/google-cloud-home.png)

From the quick access menu click **APIs & Services** and then from the sidebar click **OAuth consent screen**. There it should just have a button in the middle saying **Get Started**, let's click that.

:::info
Google has changed the OAuth section and this guide uses the new OAuth experience. If you see a button saying try the new OAuth experience, please click it so that the guide looks the same as the Google Cloud Console.
:::

After clicking the button you should see this screen:

![Configure OAuth Consent Screen](/screenshots/google-cloud-oauth-configure.png)

There for app name just use `Tinyauth` and for support email the only option should be your email address.

For audience use the only available type which is **External**.

For contact information, fill in your email address.

Finally agree to the use data policy and click **Create**. After some time you should see the OAuth homepage which looks like this:

![Google Cloud OAuth Home](/screenshots/google-cloud-oauth-home.png)

In this screen click **Create OAuth Client**.

:::info
You may see a warning saying that you haven't configured your OAuth Consent Screen, if you see this warning just refresh the page a couple of times and it should let you create your client.
:::

For application type select web application.

If you like you can give it another name rather than `Web Client 1` which is the default.

For Authorized Redirect URIs click **Add URI** and fill in your domain alongside with the `/api/oauth/callback/google` suffix, e.g. `https://tinyauth.example.com/api/oauth/callback/google`.

Finally click create.

After your application gets created you should have a screen like this:

![Google Cloud OAuth Clients](/screenshots/google-cloud-oauth-created.png)

Click your client, e.g. `Web Client 1` and copy your Client ID and Client secret shown in the Additional Information section and that's it! We are done with the Google Cloud Console and we can now configure Tinyauth.

## Configure Tinyauth

Now that you have your client ID and secret, you can add the following environment variables to the Tinyauth docker container:

```yaml
environment:
  - GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
  - GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-secret
```

:::warning
OAuth doesn't mean security, with the current setup everybody with a Github account can login to Tinyauth as a normal user. If you would like to limit which users can login with OAuth, you can add the `OAUTH_WHITELIST` environment variable and only allow your email address to login. For more information check the [configuration](/docs/reference/configuration.md) page.
:::

:::tip
Since you have OAuth enabled, you can now remove the `USERS` or `USERS_FILE` environment variables so as you can only login with your OAuth provider.
:::

And you are done! After you restart Tinyauth and try to login to an app, you should have an additional option to login with Google.
